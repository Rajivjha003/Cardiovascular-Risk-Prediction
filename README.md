## Methods
The CHD prediction model employs a combination of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. It involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
2. Model Development: Utilize logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests for initial predictions.
3. Ensemble Learning: Implement model stacking and/or gradient boosting to combine individual model predictions.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Conduct an extensive search for optimal hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Flask API and Dockerization
To make the CHD prediction model accessible as an API, I created a Flask application. The Flask API allows users to interact with the model and obtain predictions through simple HTTP requests. Additionally, I containerized the Flask application using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability across different platforms and environments.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
For a streamlined development process, I set up a CI/CD pipeline using YAML configuration files. The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring that the application is thoroughly tested and deployed efficiently.

## Deployment on Render Server
The CHD prediction model was successfully deployed on the Render server, providing a live and accessible endpoint for users to access the Flask API.
